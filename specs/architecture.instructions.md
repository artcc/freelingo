# Architecture — FreeLingo

This is the general architecture reference — the project "organigram". For backend-specific architecture (models, services, routers, env vars, Python standards) see [architecture-backend.instructions.md](architecture-backend.instructions.md). For frontend-specific architecture (pages, components, stores, TypeScript standards) see [architecture-frontend.instructions.md](architecture-frontend.instructions.md).

> API endpoints are documented separately in [api-endpoints.instructions.md](api-endpoints.instructions.md).

## Data flow — Complete assessment → study

```
User visits /assessment
    ↓
Step 1: BeginnerGate ("Have you studied this language before?")
    ↓ No → skip to A1, create plan directly
    ↓ Yes → continue
    ↓
Step 2: Adaptive quiz (15 questions, fetched from GET /api/assessment/bank)
    ↓
Step 3: Duration selector (4/8/12/16 weeks) + goals selection
    ↓
POST /api/assessment/complete → creates StudyPlan
    ↓
POST /api/study-plan/generate
    ↓
StudyPlanGenerator: distribute_units() from curriculum.py
    ↓ (deterministic — no LLM)
Persists StudyPlan with week-by-week DayPlan structure
    ↓
GET /api/study-plan/today → returns lessons for current day
    ↓ (auto-generates lesson content via LLM on first access)
LessonGenerator → LLM Adapter → structured lesson content
    ↓
Persists Lesson + Exercises in PostgreSQL; optional per-exercise native explanations remain in Lesson.content JSON
    ↓
Frontend ← Lesson content + exercises
```

## Data flow — Voice conversation

```
User opens /conversation
    ↓
Frontend: ConversationMode loads VAD (onnxruntime-web WASM)
    ↓
Start: AudioContext → microphone permission/stream → await vad.start() → warmup
    ↓
WebSocket connects to /ws/conversation
    ↓
Client sends first JSON auth frame with access token
    ↓
Backend validates auth, subscription, freemium trial/quota, maintenance mode, TTS service, STT service, quota, and selected target language plan
    ↓
User speaks → VAD detects speech → sends WAV chunks via WS
    ↓
ConversationPipeline:
  STT Service: WAV → text
  LLM Adapter: text → full response
  TTS Service: each sentence → MP3
    ↓
MP3 chunks sent back via WebSocket
  Frontend: AudioQueue schedules gapless playback
    ↓
Stable turn guard: frontend ignores user speech while the tutor turn is active
```

Warmup runs only after microphone permission and VAD startup succeed. Component-owned streams, serialized VAD operations, idempotent cleanup, and attempt/socket identity guards isolate restarts and late callbacks. The turn guard starts before WAV submission; recoverable STT/LLM/TTS errors release it without disconnecting, while fatal failures release session resources. VAD misfires discard unfinished speech and reset its indicator.

Pronunciation exercises and flashcard speaking mode use the authenticated REST STT flow instead of the conversation WebSocket. `VoiceRecorder` captures the owning lesson or flashcard `study_plan_id` when recording starts, stops microphone streams that resolve after cancellation or unmount, uploads the plan with the WAV, and awaits the resource-specific transcription handler before becoming available again. Browser cancellation propagates through the Next.js proxy to the backend request, and flashcard review controls remain locked until voice-result handling finishes. The backend verifies ownership, resolves the plan's BCP-47 target language, converts it to ISO 639-1, and passes that language explicitly to the configured STT provider. Missing or foreign plan context is rejected, and the service contract has no implicit English fallback.

## Auth design

- access_token — Type: JWT; Algorithm: HS256; Duration: 15 min; Storage: Zustand store (JS memory)
- refresh_token — Type: Opaque UUID4; Algorithm: random; Duration: 30 days; Storage: httpOnly cookie + Redis: `refresh:{token}` → user_id
- email verification — Type: Opaque UUID4; Algorithm: random; Duration: 24 h; Storage: Redis: `verify_email:{token}` → user_id
- password reset — Type: Opaque UUID4; Algorithm: random; Duration: 1 h; Storage: Redis: `reset_password:{token}` → user_id
- maintenance mode — Type: bool flag; Algorithm: —; Duration: indefinite; Storage: Redis: `maintenance_mode` → `"1"` or `"0"`

**Design rationale:**

- **Access token**: verified without DB hit (JWT decode only). Short lifetime limits damage if leaked.
- **Refresh token**: stored in Redis with native TTL for auto-expiry. Opaque (not JWT) so no sensitive data in the cookie.
- **Token rotation**: on refresh, old token is deleted from Redis and a new one is created — prevents replay attacks.
- **Logout**: deletes the refresh token from Redis and clears the cookie.
- **Frontend interceptor** (`apiFetch`): on 401 response, silently refreshes the access token and retries the request. On refresh failure, redirects to `/login`.

### Maintenance mode

Stored as a simple Redis flag (`maintenance_mode` = `"1"` / `"0"`). Set explicitly by the admin at runtime via `PUT /api/admin/maintenance` — no restart required.

**Backend guard** (`app/core/deps.py`):

- `get_redis()` — centralized async Redis dependency.
- `check_maintenance_mode()` — raises HTTP 503 when `maintenance_mode == "1"`. Swallows Redis errors to fail open.
- `require_subscription` — checks only subscription status. It does not consult maintenance mode.
- `require_subscription_or_freemium(feature: str)` — factory dependency that checks: 1) `STRIPE_ENABLED=false` → pass, 2) subscribed → pass, 3) freemium trial active → pass, 4) freemium quota available for the feature → pass, 5) else → HTTP 402 with `{reason: "freemium_exhausted"}`. Used on chat, listening, reading, conversation warmup, and lesson completion endpoints. Memory management requires authentication only.
- `require_not_maintenance` — checks only the `maintenance_mode` flag for operational feature availability. Non-admin users receive HTTP 503 when maintenance is active; admins bypass the guard so they can verify gated features during maintenance. Applied explicitly alongside subscription/freemium checks on chat, listening, reading, and conversation warmup endpoints. The WebSocket (`/ws/conversation`) performs the same maintenance check manually. Memory-management endpoints intentionally remain available.

Memories are global per user. Text chat and voice load the same collection, use a normalized native `save_user_memory` tool with one continuation round, and retain `study_plan_id` only as nullable provenance. Deleting a language sets that provenance to `NULL` rather than deleting memory.

The dashboard announcement is a global PostgreSQL singleton. Admins generate its ten UI-locale translations through the existing LLM adapter and can edit them before saving; public config exposes only an active banner's translations and revision. Authenticated dismissal stores that revision on the user, so content revisions reappear while activation-only changes preserve dismissal.

**Frontend**: `MaintenanceGate` component renders a static banner when `maintenance_mode` is true for non-admin users. Applied on top of `PaywallGate` in the four subscription-gated pages: `/chat`, `/conversation`, `/listening`, `/reading`. Administrators manage the flag from the dedicated `/admin/system` section; the admin overview keeps a read-only status summary linking to that page.

**Public exposure**: `GET /api/config` returns `maintenance_mode: bool` so the frontend can read the state without an authenticated request.

## Tests

Testing infrastructure and strategy are documented in [testing.instructions.md](testing.instructions.md).

**Summary:**

- **Backend**: pytest + pytest-asyncio, 45 test files, 1019 tests, 85.56% last measured coverage (target: 70%)
- **Frontend**: Confirmed pre-push Vitest result of 494 passed across 50 test files, including all 13 `ConversationMode` lifecycle cases (6.58 s). These lifecycle tests use mocks and do not validate real microphone behavior in a browser; manual validation against the remote deployment remains pending. Existing areas include stores, components, hooks, lib, i18n, app pages, the static landing preview and session-aware CTAs, accessible plan-state indicators, Stripe-aware admin subscription visibility, dashboard announcements, billing paywall UI, billing success verification, feedback unread labels, SSE parsing, memory toasts, chat stream resets, and middleware; coverage is not configured/reported
- **E2E**: Playwright (planned, not yet implemented)
