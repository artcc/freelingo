# Testing — FreeLingo

## Overview

- Backend unit + integration — Framework: pytest + pytest-asyncio; Scope: API endpoints, services, SM-2 algorithm, data integrity; Coverage: 85.56% last measured (target: 70%); Status: Implemented
- Frontend unit — Framework: Vitest; Scope: Stores, components, hooks, lib, middleware; Coverage: Not configured; Status: Implemented
- E2E — Framework: Playwright; Scope: Critical user flows; Coverage: Smoke; Status: Pending

CI requires all tests to pass on every push. The already-executed pre-push run confirmed successful formatting with `./scripts/format.sh`, backend pytest with 1019 passed and 137 warnings (85.56% coverage), successful frontend `npm run lint` and `tsc --noEmit`, and Vitest with 494 passed across 50 files, including all 13 ConversationMode cases (6.58 s). No checks were rerun for this documentation update. Backend coverage threshold configured at 70%, last measured at 85.56%. Frontend tests cover stores, critical components (VoiceRecorder, AudioPlayer, ProfileSection, UnitCard/UnitDrawer, LanguageSwitcher, TargetLanguageSelector, DashboardAnnouncement, review UI, LanguageBubbles, billing paywall UI, memory toast), Stripe-aware admin subscription visibility, the admin announcement editor, billing success verification, app pages, hooks, lib modules, SSE framing and reset handling, i18n, and middleware. Frontend coverage is not currently reported because Vitest coverage is not configured and `@vitest/coverage-v8` is not installed.

## Backend tests (pytest)

### Test infrastructure

- **Database**: SQLite in-memory (`sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:`) for fast, isolated tests — no PostgreSQL dependency. Tables are auto-created/dropped per test via `setup_db` fixture.
- **Redis**: mocked with an in-memory dict-based mock (implements `setex`, `get`, `delete`, `getex` with same interface as `redis.asyncio.Redis`). No Redis server needed.
- **LLM**: always mocked at the service layer. Tests never call real Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek.
- **HTTP client**: `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport` for FastAPI app testing, database and Redis dependencies overridden via `app.dependency_overrides`.
- **Async**: `asyncio_mode = "auto"` — no `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators needed.
- **Warnings**: pytest filters known external `slowapi` deprecations (`python_multipart` pending deprecation and Python `cgi` deprecation) so the suite output stays focused on project warnings.

### Coverage

- **Current coverage**: 85.56% last measured (above 70% target)
- **Configured threshold**: 70% (enforced via `pytest --cov-fail-under=70`)

### Test patterns

**Mocking LLM**: Mock `llm_adapter.LLMAdapter` as a singleton. Three pattern variants:

- `chat()` → returns a deterministic string (used in assessment, flashcards, chat tests)
- `chat(stream=True)` → returns an async generator yielding token chunks (used in chat SSE tests)
- `structured_output()` → returns a pre-built Pydantic model (used in assessment, lesson, flashcard, reading, and listening tests)

**Mocking Redis**: Mock `get_redis` dependency. The in-memory mock stores `refresh:{token}` → user_id mappings and `invite:{token}` → "1" for invite tokens, matching the real Redis interface.

**Test user creation**: The `test_user` and `admin_user` fixtures create users directly in the test database and return them with pre-built JWT Authorization headers. Each test gets a fresh database via the `setup_db` fixture's autouse create/drop cycle.

### Key test cases

**Auth**:

- Register success, duplicate username rejection, ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false returns 403, first user becomes admin
- Login success sets httpOnly cookie, invalid credentials return 401, inactive user returns 401
- Refresh rotates token (deletes old, creates new), missing cookie returns 401, replayed token returns 401
- Logout deletes refresh token from Redis and clears cookie
- PATCH /me updates display_name, email, password, english_variant, conversation settings

**Flashcards (SM-2)**:

- New card has default values: ease_factor=2.5, interval=0, repetitions=0, next_review=today
- Quality 0 resets repetitions to 0, sets interval to 1
- Quality 3: first review interval=1, second=6, subsequent=interval × ease_factor
- Ease factor increases with quality 5, decreases with quality < 3, floor at 1.3
- Next review date calculated correctly as today + interval days

**Admin**:

- List/create/get/update/delete users requires admin role; non-admin returns 403
- Invite token created with 48-hour TTL, returned as URL `/register?invite=<token>`

**Assessment**:

- Deterministic evaluation finds highest level with >= 2 questions and >= 60% correct
- Free-write evaluation (mocked LLM) returns adjusted_level, score, analysis
- Level test generation (mocked LLM) constrained to grammar/vocabulary from curriculum

**WebSocket conversation**:

- Connection with valid JWT succeeds
- Connection rejected with 4001 close code when either configured speech service is unavailable
- Pipeline lifecycle: connect → auth → audio receive → STT → LLM → TTS → send → disconnect

**Data integrity**:

- Every grammar_slug in curriculum.ts referenced by curriculum units exists in grammar.ts
- Every vocabulary_set_id referenced by each language's curriculum exists in that language's backend vocabulary data, including Japanese, Korean, and Mainland Chinese.
- Every related grammar slug in grammar topics points to an existing topic

## E2E tests (Playwright — pending)

### Planned critical flows

```
frontend/e2e/
├── auth.spec.ts            # Register → login → logout, protected routes
├── assessment.spec.ts      # Complete placement test, view results
├── study-plan.spec.ts      # Generate plan, view today's lessons
├── lesson.spec.ts          # Complete a full lesson with exercises
├── flashcards.spec.ts      # Review session, SM-2 progression
├── chat.spec.ts            # Send message, receive streaming response
└── admin.spec.ts           # Create user, generate invite, edit roles
```

### Design notes

- E2E tests run against a deployed instance (remote server), not a local Docker Compose stack
- The web server is started separately — Playwright config uses `reuseExistingServer: true` with a target URL
- Tests use `data-testid` attributes on key interactive elements (buttons, inputs, status indicators)
- Each spec is independent — tests within a spec are isolated by fresh browser contexts

---

## CI integration

CI runs on GitHub Actions, triggered on pushes and pull requests. The project is self-hosted; CI is for quality gates before Docker packaging.

### Workflow

- Backend setup selects Python 3.14, installs pip 26.2.1, and installs `backend/requirements.txt` with its included `backend/constraints.txt`. Both files participate in the pip cache key; test plugins use the same pins as the application environment.
- Backend tests — Steps: `pytest -v`; Threshold: >= 70% coverage
- Frontend lint — Steps: `npm run lint`; Threshold: Zero errors
- Frontend typecheck — Steps: `npx tsc --noEmit`; Threshold: Clean output
- Frontend tests — Steps: `npm run test:run`; Threshold: All tests pass (confirmed pre-push result: 494 passed across 50 files, including 13 ConversationMode cases)

**Note**: The backend test job uses SQLite (same as local tests), not PostgreSQL. No Docker services are required for the backend test job.

### Pre-push skill

The `run-tests` opencode skill is available for requested test, lint, typecheck, or targeted verification runs.

The `pre-push` opencode skill mirrors CI locally. The canonical all-in-one command is `./scripts/pre-push.sh`; it synchronizes the backend dependencies and auto-formats before running checks. The canonical formatter-only command is `./scripts/format.sh`. Run order:

1. Activate the project virtual environment, install pip 26.2.1, and synchronize backend dependencies using `backend/requirements.txt` and its included constraints.
2. Auto-format (`./scripts/format.sh`: ruff --fix, black, eslint --fix, prettier --write from fixed backend/frontend directories)
3. Backend tests (pytest)
4. Frontend lint (npm run lint)
5. Frontend typecheck (tsc --noEmit)
6. Frontend tests (vitest)

- **Mock LLM always** — never call Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek in tests
- **Mock Redis always** — use in-memory dict mock, no Redis server needed
- **In-memory SQLite for backend tests** — fast, isolated, no Docker dependency
- **Test SM-2 algorithm in isolation** — pure function, no DB needed for the algorithm itself
- **Test streaming endpoints with chunk assertions** — verify SSE format and token ordering
- **Test error states explicitly** — 401, 403, 409, 422, 500 for every major endpoint
- **Each test file runs independently** — no shared state between files, fresh DB per test
- **Coverage thresholds enforced** — backend >= 70% (enforced); frontend coverage is not configured
- **No `docker compose` in test configs** — the development environment does not have Docker locally; E2E tests target a remote deployment
- **Data integrity tests validate cross-file references** — ensures curriculum, grammar, and backend vocabulary data files stay consistent across backend language packages, including Japanese, Korean, and Mainland Chinese.
- **Frontend: test critical logic + components** — test stores, utils, API client, middleware, and key components (VoiceRecorder, AudioPlayer, ProfileSection, UnitCard/UnitDrawer, LanguageSwitcher)
- **Frontend: mock `localStorage` and `next/navigation` globally** in `tests/setup.ts` — individual test files should not re-mock these
- **Frontend: tests live in `frontend/tests/`** — not co-located with source files, mirroring the backend `tests/` convention
- **Frontend: Component tests use vitest + @testing-library/react** — mock browser APIs (AudioContext, getUserMedia, FileReader) and external dependencies (next-intl, next/image, next/navigation)
- **Failure handling** — if any backend or frontend test fails after launching a suite, stop, report the failing test(s), and ask the user how to proceed before modifying production code or tests. After approval, re-run only the failing command unless the user requests the full suite.
